Hi, I'm Kevin. I'm an aspiring front end developer, software developer, data scientist. Really, a jack of all trades.
I'm currently enrolled at Southern Connecticut State University and I'm looking to collaborate on projects of any kind
as I'm always interested in learning new topics and challenging myself.
